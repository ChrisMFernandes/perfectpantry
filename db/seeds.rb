Recipe.create(name: "Nutella Crescent Rolls", directions: "1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll the crescent roll dough. Spread a thin layer of nutella on each piece of dough (stopping about an inch or two before the end of the skinnier side). Roll the crescent rolls up. After theyâ€™re rolled up, make sure you roll them back and forth a couple of times to seal the edges of the dough. 2. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown. Let cool for about 5-10 minutes and then dust with some powdered sugar. The rolls can be served immediately or last a couple of days if tightly wrapped.
